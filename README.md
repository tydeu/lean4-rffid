# Reverse FFI w/ Dependencies

This a simple example of how a Lake library with a Mathlib dependency can be used from a foreign language and build system (`main.c` and `Makefile`). Adapted from code written by Sebastian Ullrich in [leanprover/lean4#2381](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/2381).
